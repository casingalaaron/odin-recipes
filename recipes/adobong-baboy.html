<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Pork:</strong>1 to 2 lbs of pork belly (liempo) or pork shoulder (kasim), cut into cubes.</li>
    <li><strong>Vinegar:</strong>½ cup of white distilled vinegar or cane vinegar.</li>
    <li><strong>Soy Sauce:</strong>½ cup of soy sauce (provides saltiness and the deep brown color).</li>
    <li><strong>Garlic:</strong>5 to 10 cloves, crushed or minced.</li>
    <li><strong>Bay Leaves:</strong>3 to 4 dried pieces (laurel).</li>
    <li><strong>Peppercorns:</strong>1 to 2 teaspoons of whole black peppercorns.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps | Instructions</h3>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Marinate (Optional but Recommended): </strong>In a large bowlm combine the pork, soy sauce, and garlic. Mix well and marinate in hte refrigerator for at least 30 minutes, or preferable overnigh for a deeper flavor</li>
    <li><strong>Saute Aromatics: </strong>Heat the cooking oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Sauté the chopped onion and the remaining garlic (if you reserved some from the marinade) until fragrant.
</li>
    <li><strong>Brown the Pork: </strong>Add the pork pieces to the pot and cook until lightly browned on all sides.</li>
    <li><strong>Add Liquids & Spices: </strong>Pour in the reserved marinade (if you marinated separately), water, vinegar, bay leaves, and black peppercorns. Do not stir immediately after adding the vinegar; bring the mixture to a boil first, which helps mellow the raw vinegar taste.</li>
    <li><strong>Simmer: </strong>Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let it simmer for about 40 minutes to 1 hour, or until the pork is fork-tender.</li>
    <li><strong>Reduce the Sauce: </strong>Remove the lid and increase the heat to medium-high. Continue to simmer for an additional 10–15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce has reduced and thickened to a glaze.</li>
    <li><strong>Season and Serve: </strong>Stir in the brown sugar, if using, and adjust the seasoning with salt to taste. Discard the bay leaves. Serve hot with steamed rice.</li>
